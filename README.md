# Hand-Detection Project

This project focuses on hand detection using the "hand" model without requiring GPU support. The entire detection process relies on OpenCV2. The model identifies the hand and provides information about the 20 hand joints. After opening an image using Python, the images are named from 0 to 6. With the help of OpenCV2 and a simple prediction code, the project makes predictions between the hand numbers and image numbers. The hand displays the figure, while OpenCV2 performs image predictions.
